# CNN-build-from-scratch
## Note:
This repository is based on CS5242 Neural Networks and Deep Learning Assignment 1. 
## Description:
The objective is to build an Convolution Neural Network pipeline from scratch without using existing packages like TensorFlow.
The CS5242_Assignment_1.ipynb file contains the overall workflow and testing scripts. 
The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset and obtained ~97% accuracy without any tuning.
